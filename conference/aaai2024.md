### [GxVAEs: Two Joint VAEs Generate Hit Molecules from Gene Expression Profiles](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/29248)
This study proposes a novel deep generative model called GxVAEs to generate hit-like molecules from gene expression profiles by leveraging two joint variational autoencoders (VAEs).

### [Reliable Conflictive Multi-view Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16897v2.pdf)
Real-world multi-view data may contain lowquality conflictive instances, which show conflictive information in different views.
we point out a new Reliable Conflictive Multiview Learning (RCML) problem, which requires the model
to provide decision results and attached reliabilities for conflictive multi-view data. We develop an Evidential Conflictive Multi-view Learning (ECML) method for this problem.

### [Proportional Aggregation of Preferences for Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14858)
We study the problem of fair sequential decision making given voter preferences. In each round, a decision rule must choose a decision from a set of alternatives where each voter reports which of these alternatives they approve. Instead of going with the most popular choice in each round, we aim for proportional representation. We formalize this aim using axioms based on Proportional Justified Representation (PJR), which were proposed in the literature on multi-winner voting and were recently adapted to multi-issue decision making. 

### [DISCount: Counting in Large Image Collections with Detector-Based Importance Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03151)
Many modern applications use computer vision to detect and count objects in massive image collections. However, when the detection task is very difficult or in the presence of domain shifts, the counts may be inaccurate even with significant investments in training data and model development. We propose DISCount -- a detector-based importance sampling framework for counting in large image collections that integrates an imperfect detector with human-in-the-loop screening to produce unbiased estimates of counts. We propose techniques for solving counting problems over multiple spatial or temporal regions using a small number of screened samples and estimate confidence intervals. 

### [Nowcasting Temporal Trends Using Indirect Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06643)
Indirect surveys, in which respondents provide information about other people they know, have been proposed for estimating (nowcasting) the size of a \emph{hidden population} where privacy is important or the hidden population is hard to reach. Examples include estimating casualties in an earthquake, conditions among female sex workers, and the prevalence of drug use and infectious diseases. The Network Scale-up Method (NSUM) is the classical approach to developing estimates from indirect surveys, but it was designed for one-shot surveys. Further, it requires certain assumptions and asking for or estimating the number of individuals in each respondent's network. 

## Saliency

### [Occluded Person Re-identification via Saliency-Guided Patch Transfer](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28312)
This assumption brings about a signifcant performance degradation when suffering from occlusion caused
by various obstacles in real-world applications. To address
this issue, data-driven strategies have emerged to enhance
the model’s robustness to occlusion.
To overcome this limitation and fully exploit the real
scene information in datasets, this paper proposes a more
intuitive and effective data-driven strategy named SaliencyGuided Patch Transfer (SPT). Combined with the vision
transformer, SPT divides person instances and background
obstacles using salient patch selection.

### [Finding Visual Saliency in Continuous Spike Stream](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.06233v1)
In this paper, we investigate the visual saliency in the continuous spike stream for the first time.
To effectively process the binary spike stream, we propose
a Recurrent Spiking Transformer (RST) framework, which
is based on a full spiking neural network. Our framework
enables the extraction of spatio-temporal features from the
continuous spatio-temporal spike stream while maintaining
low power consumption. To facilitate the training and validation of our proposed model, we build a comprehensive
real-world spike-based visual saliency dataset, enriched with
numerous light conditions.
