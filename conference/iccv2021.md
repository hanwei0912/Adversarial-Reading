## Robustness

### [Amplitude-Phase Recombination: Rethinking Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks in Frequency Domain](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chen_Amplitude-Phase_Recombination_Rethinking_Robustness_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_in_Frequency_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
In this paper, we notice that the CNN tends to converge at the local optimum which is closely related to the high-frequency components of the training images, while the amplitude spectrum is easily disturbed such as noises or common corruptions. In contrast, more empirical studies found that humans rely on more phase components to achieve robust recognition. This observation leads to more explanations of the CNN's generalization behaviors in both robustness to common perturbations and out-of-distribution detection, and motivates a new perspective on data augmentation designed by re-combing the phase spectrum of the current image and the amplitude spectrum of the distracter image. That is, the generated samples force the CNN to pay more attention to the structured information from phase components and keep robust to the variation of the amplitude.

- extract the feature and group features channel-wise, and calculate the importance of each feature
- dynamically suppress significant activation values of CNN by group-wise inhibition, but not fixedly or randomly handle them when training
- need training
- use the idea of masked feature for prediction

1. estimate attributions of different image regions to the decrease of the attacking cost based on the
Shapley value
2. define and quantify interactions among
adversarial perturbation pixels, and decompose the entire perturbation map into *relatively independent perturbation components*

- transparent embedding space
- grassmann manifold
- objective: construct the basis concpets and build the dicesion function
- embedding space learning -> construct the basic conceots: (1)orthonormilay loss, basis vectors should be indipendent to each other; (2) separation for class-aware subspace, maximize the projection metric amoing each pair of subspaces; (3) hight-level patches grouping, compact patches from same concept and separat patches from different concpet; (4) identification: classification cross entropy
- embedding space transparent -> know the meaning of each basic concept
- concept based classification
