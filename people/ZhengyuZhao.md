### [On Success and Simplicity: A Second Look at Transferable Targeted Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11207.pdf)

- In particular, we, for the first time, identify that a simple
logit loss can yield competitive results with the state of the arts. Our analysis
spans a variety of transfer settings, especially including three new, realistic settings: an ensemble transfer setting with little model similarity, a worse-case setting
with low-ranked target classes, and also a real-world attack against the Google
Cloud Vision API
- Simple transferable attacks are surprisingly good when given enough iterations to converge.
- A simple yet stronger logit attack.

- Adversarial Color Enhancement (ACE)
- systematic robustness analysis of ACE from both the attack and defense perspectives by varying the bound of the color filter parameters

### [Towards Large yet Imperceptible Adversarial Image Perturbations with Perceptual Color Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02466)

- Perceptual Color distance C&W (PerC-C&W), extends the widely-used C&W approach and produces larger RGB perturbations. PerC-C&W is able to maintain adversarial strength, while contributing to imperceptibility. Our second approach, Perceptual Color distance Alternating Loss (PerC-AL), achieves the same outcome, but does so more efficiently by alternating between the classification loss and perceptual color difference when updating perturbations.
