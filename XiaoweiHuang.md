#### [CasGCN: Predicting future cascade growth based on information diffusion graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05152.pdf)

- task: cascade growth prediction
- method: graph convolutional network
- insight for me: The graph can be saved in a matrix and we could multiply it with another matrix to do things like diffusion. It is possible to have graph convolutional network


#### [Explaining Image Classifiers using Statistical Fault Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02374)

- use Statistical fault localization techniques from software engineering. Define an explanation as a minimal subset of features sufficient for making the same decision as for the original inputs.
- DeepCover: ranking of the features of the inputs using SFL, constructs explanation for the decision of the DNN based on this ranking.


#### [Generalizing Universal Adversarial Attacks Beyond Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07788.pdf)

- universal adversarial attack + spatial transformation
- using generator
