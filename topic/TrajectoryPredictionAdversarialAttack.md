- three contributions: (1) deterministic attack that creates a deterministic gradient path within a probabilistic model to generate adversarial samples. (2) a hybrid objective that interleaves the adversarial training and learning from
clean data to anchor the model output on stable clean data distribution (3) a domain-specific data augmentation
technique for trajectory prediction via a dynamic model.
