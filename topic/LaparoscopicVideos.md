Training Data Overview
The dataset we are providing will be made up of 8x 225-frame videos of stereo camera images acquired from a da Vinci Xi robot during several different porcine procedures. To avoid redundancy, we sample the frames from 30 Hz video at 2 Hz. To extract the 1280x1024 camera images from the video frames, crop the image from the pixel (320, 28).
