The risk is compounded by the fact that explanations do not take into account the semantic meaning of the explained objects. To escape from the trap of static and meaningless explanations, we propose a tool and a process called LIMEcraft. LIMEcraft enhances the process of explanation by allowing a user to interactively select semantically consistent areas and thoroughly examine the prediction for the image instance in case of many image features.

In this paper, we propose a pair of complementary contributions that improve upon the state of the art for
region-based explanations in both accuracy and utility. The
first is SWAG, a method for generating accurate explanations quickly using superpixels for discriminative regions
which is meant to be a more accurate, efficient, and tunable
drop in replacement method for Grad-CAM, LIME, or other
region-based methods. The second contribution is based on
an investigation into how to best generate the superpixels
used to represent the features found within the image. Using
SWAG, we compare using superpixels created from the image, a combination of the image and backpropagated gradients, and the gradients themselves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method proposed to generate explanations using superpixels explicitly created to represent the
discriminative features important to the network.

In this work we introduce
the idea of scoring superpixels through the use of gradient based pixel scoring techniques.
We show qualitatively and quantitatively that this is able to approximate LIME, in a fraction of the time. We investigate our techniques using both image classification, and action
recognition networks on large scale datasets (ImageNet and Kinetics-400 respectively)
