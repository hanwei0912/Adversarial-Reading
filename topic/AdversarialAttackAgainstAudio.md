(i) versatile – it is able to deceive a range of end-to-end acoustic systems under both
white-box and black-box settings; (ii) eective – it is able to generate adversarial audios that can be recognized as specic phrases by
target acoustic systems; and (iii) stealthy – it is able to generate adversarial audios indistinguishable from their benign counterparts to
human perception.
