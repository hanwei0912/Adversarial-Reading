- **CAM** established one approach towards interpretability, class activation maps. Interpretability as saliency for discriminative regions (2015)
- **Grad-CAM** generalization of CAM. Use gradient to obtain weight importance and no need of training (2016)
- **Smooth Grad** improving stand gradient by adding noise and make the average (2017)
- **Grad-CAM++** improving Grad-CAM by soveling the issues that there are multiple accurrences of same object with slightly different orientations or views. It takes a weighted average of pixel-wise gradients (2018)
- **Smooth Grad-CAM++** smooth grad + grad-CAM++; takes interest in grad-CAM++'s apprach for getting fradient weights by adding the denoising in the partial derivatives (2019)
- **Score CAM** get rid of gradient dependency, assigns weights for each activation map by forward pass score on target class. They define tha increase in confidence by the contribution ci for a known baseline input xb, xi towards y, which is the change in the output by replacing the ith entry in xb with xi.(2020)
- **Integrated Grad** take the integrad of the gradient, find a path from baseline (random image or black image) to input, then calculate the gradients for each of points and make the average, multiply it with the difference between baseline and input.(2020)
- **IS-CAM** score CAM + integrated grad (2020) 
- **SS-CAM** smooth grad + score CAM(2020)
- **LagerCAM** grad CAM variant leveraging pixel-wise contribution to gradient to the activation(2020)
