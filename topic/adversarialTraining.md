- update network weights every step when generating adversarial examples

### [Adversarial Robustness Against the Union of Multiple Perturbation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04068.pdf)

- In this work, we
develop a natural generalization of the standard
PGD-based procedure to incorporate multiple perturbation models into a single attack, by taking
the worst-case over all steepest descent directions.
This approach has the advantage of directly converging upon a trade-off between different perturbation models which minimizes the worst-case
performance over the union
